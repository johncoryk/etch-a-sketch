<h1>Sketchy: an 'Etch-a-Sketch' project</h1>
This was a project I made from <a href="theodinproject.com">The Odin Project</a>. 

If you'd like to check out the working version, you can take it for a spin here: <a href="https://johncoryk.github.io/etch-a-sketch/">Sketchy</a>.

<h2>My Process</h2>
This project was hard... very hard. This honestly was the first time that I thought 'coding' or 'programming' just was not for me. After seeing this project pop up in the curriculum I had instant 'deer in the headlights'--I had no idea where to start.

After days of studying other's code, going back through the curriculum to see what I had missed, and brushing up on things like DOM manipulation, CSS grid, and basic JS, I finally made a breakthrough. 

I started and restarted about five times, but I learned so much in doing so. I'm a graphic designer first, so creating a nice layout in Illustrator or XD was my first step. After having a solid foundation and 'roadmap' to work from, I got started on HTML and CSS elements.

Javascript was by far the most challending part of the exercise and it pushed me to my limits. In doing this project though, I found that it's not always about knowing the right answers, but how to FIND the right answers.

I've learned so much by just googling and reading for certain aspects I needed to implement here. When someone says you need to learn by doing with programming, they're spot on.

I had seen others implement a shader feature, but I'm not quite ready to tackle that feature here yet. After working on this for a week straight, I'm just ready to move on. In the future I may revisit this project and make it 'cooler'.

Thanks for reading!

<h3>Advice</h3>
Read code, read code, and read some more code. Studying code helped me more than anything else.
